# interviewMatcher
This Python program is designed to match volunteers with applicants based on specified criteria. It takes in CSV files for volunteers and applicants, transforms the data for easy comparison, calculates similarity points, and then generates assignments. The user can choose to get assignments for all volunteers or a specific one, with the flexibility to customize output file names. It's a handy tool for efficiently pairing volunteers with suitable applicants in your project.
